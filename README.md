Welcome to my javascript testing repository!

This isn't a repository that has anything to add for experienced programmers, just some experiences that aren't explicitly clarified.

For beginners like me, if this repository helps, even if it's just one person, I'll be extremely happy already. And if you have any questions, open an issue and I'll be happy to try to help and learn with you.
