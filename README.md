# ruan.website.testjs
Welcome to my javascript testing repository!

This isn't a repository that has anything to add for experienced programmers, just some experiences that aren't explicitly clarified.

For beginners like me, if this repository helps, even if it's just one person, I'll be extremely happy already. And if you have any questions, open an issue and I'll be happy to try to help and learn with you.

For other learning projects, visit my other repositories:
* [Back-end/Hapi](https://github.com/decimo3/ruan.node.hapijs): Simple server app with @hapi/hapi framework and some of its plugins, to build a simple CRUD for learning.
* [Front-end/Vue](https://github.com/decimo3/ruan.site.vuejs): Simple (and ugly) site made with the Vue framework used to build a SPA (single page application) for learning.
* [Fullstack/Vanilla](https://github.com/decimo3/ruan.website.vanilla): System for registering teams and exporting in CSV (Work in progress).
